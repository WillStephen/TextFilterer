Truman Burbank: Who are you?
Christof: I am the creator... of a television show that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
Truman Burbank: Then who am I?
Christof: You're the star.
Truman Burbank: Was nothing real?
Christof: *You* were real. That's what made you so good to watch.
[Truman turns back to face the door]
Christof: Listen to me, Truman. There's no more truth out there than there is in the world I created for you. The same lies. The same deceit. But in my world, you have nothing to fear. I know you better than you know yourself.
